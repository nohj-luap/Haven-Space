Key Differences & Rationale
Boarder Process (Streamlined)
Why Simple: Boarders are customers seeking accommodation - friction reduces conversions
Risk Level: Lower risk to platform (they're paying, not collecting money)
Verification Timing: Post-registration to maintain momentum
Access Level: Immediate browsing, delayed application submission
Landlord Process (Comprehensive)
Why Complex: Landlords handle money and provide services - higher verification needed
Risk Level: Higher risk (property fraud, fake listings, payment disputes)
Verification Timing: Pre-activation to prevent fraudulent listings
Access Level: Read-only until verified, full access post-approval
Technical Implementation Notes
Database States
-- User status progression
users.status: 'pending_email' → 'active' (boarders)
users.status: 'pending_email' → 'pending_verification' → 'active' (landlords)

-- Landlord-specific verification
landlord_profiles.verification_status: 'pending' → 'approved'/'rejected'
Middleware Behavior
Unverified Landlords: Can read but blocked from write operations
Unverified Boarders: Can browse but blocked from applications
Email Unverified: Limited access until email confirmed
Google OAuth Integration
Same verification requirements apply
OAuth users skip password step but follow same verification flow
Pre-populate available information from Google profile
This approach balances user experience with platform security, ensuring legitimate landlords while keeping boarder onboarding friction-free.
