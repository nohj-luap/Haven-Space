| View | URL Path | Description |

| boarder | `/views/boarder/` | Boarder property browsing |
| admin | `/views/admin/` | Admin system management |

## Features

Each view includes:
- Navigation (loaded from `/partials/nav.html`)
- Header (loaded from `/partials/header.html`)
- Footer (loaded from `/partials/footer.html`)
- View-specific CSS from `/css/views/`
- View-specific JS from `/js/views/`

## Navigation

The app auto-detects the current view from the URL path and initializes the appropriate controller in `main.js`.
